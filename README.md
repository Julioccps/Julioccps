### 💾 The Origin Story (Constraint-Driven Development)

My journey into **Systems Programming** and **Compiler Design** wasn't born from abundance, but from limitation. I architected and built the foundations of my core projects **VanadiumOS** and the **What Language** on a machine that most would consider obsolete:

* **CPU:** Intel Celeron N4000 (1.1 GHz)
* **RAM:** 4GB
* **Storage:** 56GB eMMC

That environment taught me a crucial lesson: **Efficiency is not a luxury; it's a requirement.** Writing a kernel in Real Mode Assembly or a compiler on that hardware forced me to understand every cycle and every byte.

Today, I've upgraded the silicon (i7-12650H + Vulkan), but the philosophy remains the same: **Maximum performance, zero bloat.**

### 🛠️ The Arsenal (Low Level & Metal)

I specialize in talking to the machine without interpreters getting in the way.

### 🧠 Development Principles

*   **Self-Hosting is the Ultimate Goal:** A tool isn't truly mastered until it can create itself.
*   **Abstraction is a Leaky Faucet:** Understand the layer beneath the one you're working in.
*   **Constraints Breed Creativity:** Given infinite resources, any fool can make something work.
*   **Readability is for Humans, Performance is for the Metal:** The code must satisfy both.
